# PoirotAnalyzer

A TDD rework of a project of mine. Still lacks much of UI in this TDD version. Have been working mostly on backend and their unit testing.
A bit more about what the project is/will be about:
A tool that lets you import table-like data, define conditions in a free-form manner, build a tree of these conditions, then allocate the data along these conditions (with decent performance).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
